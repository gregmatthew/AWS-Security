277-[SF]-Lab - Systems-Hardening
AWS Systems Hardening Lab with Patch Manager

Lab Overview

In organizations managing hundreds or thousands of workstations, keeping operating systems (OS) and applications updated is logistically challenging. Administrators need a clear security policy and baseline to ensure all workstations meet minimum software version requirements. This lab utilizes Patch Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, to create and apply patch baselines. You will:





Patch Linux EC2 instances using a default baseline.



Create a custom patch baseline for Windows EC2 instances.



Use patch groups to apply the custom baseline to Windows instances.



Verify patch compliance.

Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:





Patch Linux instances using the default baseline.



Create a custom patch baseline.



Use patch groups to patch Windows instances with the custom baseline.



Verify patch compliance.

Duration

Approximately 60 minutes.

Lab Environment

The lab environment includes:





Six EC2 instances: Three with Linux OS and three with Windows OS.



Pre-configured backend components, including EC2 instances, IAM roles, and AWS services.



Task 1: Patch Linux Instances Using Default Baselines

In this task, you patch Linux EC2 instances using the default baseline for Amazon Linux 2.

Steps





Access the AWS Management Console:





At the upper-right corner, choose Start Lab.



Wait for the lab status to show a green circle (indicating readiness) next to AWS.



Choose the green circle to open the AWS Management Console in a new browser tab.

Monitor the AWS-PatchNowAssociation panel for the status of the three affected instances.



Check the Scan/Install operation summary panel until the patch operation completes.



Task 2: Create a Custom Patch Baseline for Windows Instances

In this task, you create a custom patch baseline for Windows security updates.

Steps





Navigate to Patch Manager:





In the AWS Management Console search bar, enter Systems Manager and select it.



In the left navigation pane, under Node Management, choose Patch Manager.



If prompted, choose Start with an overview (skip if not displayed).



Create a Patch Baseline:





Choose the Patch baselines tab, then select Create patch baseline.



Configure Patch baseline details:





Name: WindowsServerSecurityUpdates



Description: Windows security baseline patch



Operating system: Windows



Leave Default patch baseline unselected.



Configure Approval Rules:





In the Approval rules for operating systems section:





Rule 1:





Products: Select WindowsServer2019, deselect All.



Severity: Choose Critical.

Auto-approval: Enter 3 days.



Compliance reporting: Choose Critical.



Rule 2:





Choose Add rule.



Products: Select WindowsServer2019, deselect All.



Severity: Choose Important.



Classification: Choose SecurityUpdates.



Auto-approval: Enter 3 days.



Compliance reporting: Choose High.



Choose Create patch baseline.



Modify Patch Groups:





In the Patch baselines section, select the WindowsServerSecurityUpdates baseline (use the search bar or navigate to the second page if needed).



From the Actions dropdown, choose Modify patch groups.



Under Patch groups, enter WindowsProd.



Choose Add, then Close.



Task 3: Patch Windows Instances

In this task, you patch Windows instances using the custom patch baseline and associated tags.

Task 3.1: Tagging Windows Instances





Navigate to EC2:





In the AWS Management Console search bar, enter EC2 and select it.



Choose Instances, select the checkbox next to Windows-1, then choose the Tags tab.



Add Tags:





Choose Manage tags, then Add new tag.



Configure:





Key: Patch Group



Value: WindowsProd



Choose Save.



Repeat for Windows-2 and Windows-3 instances.

Task 3.2: Patching Windows Instances





Navigate to Patch Manager:





In the AWS Management Console search bar, enter Systems Manager and select it.



Choose Patch Manager.



If prompted, choose Start with an overview (skip if not displayed).



Patch Windows Instances:





Choose Patch now.



Configure:





Patching operation: Scan and install



Reboot option: Reboot if needed



Instances to patch: Patch only the target instances I specify



Target selection: Specify instance tags



Tag key: Patch Group



Tag value: WindowsProd



Choose Add.



Choose Patch now.



Monitor Patching:





When available, choose the Execution ID link to view the State Manager page.



Select the Output link for an instance with inProgress status.



Expand the Output panel to view details, including PatchGroup: WindowsProd.



Note: Patch Manager uses the Run Command to execute the RunPatchBaseline document.



Task 4: Verify Compliance

In this task, you verify that all instances are compliant with the applied patch baselines.

Steps





Navigate to Patch Manager:





In the left navigation pane, under Node Management, choose Patch Manager.



Check Compliance:





Choose the Dashboard tab.



Under Compliance summary, verify that Compliant: 6 is displayed (indicating all three Linux and three Windows instances are compliant).



Choose the Compliance reporting tab to view the compliance status of all instances (should show âœ“ Compliant).



Scroll right in the Node patching details panel to verify:





Critical noncompliant count



Security noncompliant count



Other noncompliant count



Last operation date



Baseline ID



View Patch Details:





Choose the Node ID for a Windows instance.



On the Node ID page, select the Patch tab.



Scroll to view applied patches and their installed Time.



Conclusion

You have successfully:





Patched Linux instances using the default baseline.



Created a custom patch baseline for Windows instances.



Used patch groups to patch Windows instances with the custom baseline.



Verified patch compliance for all instances.
