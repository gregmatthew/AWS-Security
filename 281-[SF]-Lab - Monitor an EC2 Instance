281-[SF]-Lab - Monitor an EC2 Instance
AWS EC2 Monitoring Lab: CloudWatch and SNS Configuration

This lab demonstrates how to monitor an Amazon EC2 instance using Amazon CloudWatch and Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS). The lab involves creating a CloudWatch alarm to monitor CPU utilization, setting up an SNS notification, stress-testing an EC2 instance, and creating a CloudWatch dashboard. The lab simulates a scenario where a malicious actor spikes CPU usage, triggering an alarm and notification.

Lab Overview





Duration: Approximately 60 minutes



Environment: Preconfigured EC2 instance named "Stress Test" with an attached IAM role for AWS Systems Manager Session Manager.



Objectives:





Create an Amazon SNS notification.



Configure a CloudWatch alarm.



Stress test an EC2 instance.



Confirm SNS email notification.



Create a CloudWatch dashboard.

Task 1: Configure Amazon SNS

This task sets up an SNS topic and subscribes an email address to receive notifications.





Access the AWS Management Console:





Click Start Lab at the upper-right corner of the lab instructions.



Wait for the lab status to show a green circle next to "AWS," indicating the lab is ready.



Click the green circle to open the AWS Management Console in a new browser tab.



If prompted, switch to the new Console Home.



Arrange the browser tabs to view instructions and the console side by side.



Note: Do not change the AWS Region unless instructed.



Create an SNS topic:





In the AWS Management Console, search for SNS and select Simple Notification Service.



Navigate to Topics in the left pane and click Create topic.



Configure the topic:





Type: Standard



Name: MyCwAlarm



Click Create topic.



Subscribe to the SNS topic:





On the MyCwAlarm details page, go to the Subscriptions tab and click Create subscription.



Configure the subscription:





Topic ARN: Leave default.



Protocol: Select Email.



Endpoint: Enter a valid email address you can access.



Click Create subscription.



Check your email for an AWS Notification Subscription Confirmation message and click Confirm subscription.



Verify in the AWS Console that the subscription status is Confirmed under Subscriptions.

Summary: You created an SNS topic and subscribed an email address to receive notifications.

Task 2: Create a CloudWatch Alarm

This task configures a CloudWatch alarm to monitor CPU utilization of the Stress Test EC2 instance.





Access CloudWatch:





In the AWS Management Console, search for CloudWatch and select it.



Navigate to Metrics > All metrics.



Select EC2 metrics:





Choose EC2 > Per-Instance Metrics.



Select the checkbox for CPUUtilization for the Stress Test EC2 instance.



Note: Metrics may take 5-10 minutes to appear after EC2 instance creation.



Create the alarm:





Click Create alarm and configure the following:





Metric:





Metric name: CPUUtilization



InstanceId: Leave default.



Statistic: Average



Period: 1 minute



Conditions:





Threshold type: Static



Whenever CPUUtilization is: Greater > threshold



than: 60



Alarm name: LabCPUUtilizationAlarm



Alarm description: CloudWatch alarm for Stress Test EC2 instance CPU utilization



Review and click Create alarm.

Summary: You created a CloudWatch alarm that triggers when CPU utilization exceeds 60%.

Task 3: Test the CloudWatch Alarm

This task stress-tests the EC2 instance to trigger the CloudWatch alarm and SNS notification.





Connect to the EC2 instance:





In the Vocareum console, click AWS Details and copy the EC2InstanceURL.



Paste the URL into a new browser tab to connect to the Stress Test instance via AWS Systems Manager.



Stress the CPU:





Run the following command in the terminal:

sudo stress --cpu 10 --verbose --timeout 400s



This command runs for 400 seconds, spiking CPU usage to 100%.



Monitor CPU usage:





Open another browser tab with the EC2InstanceURL and run:

top



This displays live CPU usage.



Check the CloudWatch alarm:





In the AWS Console, navigate to CloudWatch > Alarms and select LabCPUUtilizationAlarm.



Refresh the graph every minute until the alarm status changes to In alarm (may take a few minutes).



Verify that CPU utilization exceeds 60% on the graph.



Confirm SNS notification:





Check your email inbox for a notification from AWS Notifications indicating the alarm state.

Summary: You stress-tested the EC2 instance, triggered the CloudWatch alarm, and received an SNS email notification.

Task 4: Create a CloudWatch Dashboard

This task creates a CloudWatch dashboard to monitor CPU utilization.





Access CloudWatch dashboards:





In the AWS Console, navigate to CloudWatch > Dashboards.



Click Create dashboard and enter the name LabEC2Dashboard.



Add a widget:





Select Line as the widget type and click Metrics.



Choose EC2 > Per-Instance Metrics.



Select the checkbox for Stress Test instance and CPUUtilization metric. _presage



Click Create widget.



Click Save dashboard.

Summary: You created a CloudWatch dashboard to monitor the CPU utilization of the Stress Test instance.

Conclusion

In this lab, you:





Created an SNS topic and email subscription.



Configured a CloudWatch alarm for CPU utilization.



Stress-tested an EC2 instance to trigger the alarm.



Confirmed the SNS notification.



Created a CloudWatch dashboard for monitoring.

This lab simulates a scenario where high CPU usage, potentially caused by malware, triggers monitoring alerts, demonstrating AWS monitoring and notification services.

Ending the Lab





Click End Lab in the Vocareum console and confirm to terminate the lab.
